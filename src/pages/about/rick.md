Rick leads the development of Cognitantâ€™s proprietary platforms and immersive experiences for patients and healthcare professionals, which manages to incorporate all his favourite elements of technology in the one job, including game engines, smartphones and making technology solve hard-to-reach problems that no-one else has fixed yet. He has been a core part of many startups over a long career, in the beginning as an electrical engineer with a talent for software development, and more recently as a CTO for the last 10 years (after having a turn covering almost every job in between!).
