A nephrologist and intensive care specialist, Tim helped to build Doctors.net.uk, the UK’s leading online doctor community, taking on the role of CEO in 2011. When the company was acquired by M3 Group, Tim became CEO of M3’s European division up until he founded Cognitant Group in 2018. He is a mentor for the NHS clinical entrepreneur programme and serves as a non-executive director and adviser for several other health technology companies. Tim originally planned to be an engineer and spends his spare time taking things apart. Sometimes he even fixes them!
