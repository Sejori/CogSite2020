## Driving better outcomes through trusted engagement and data-driven insights 

As we make great strides with the development of novel treatments and therapies, for rare conditions for common conditions such as diabetes and cancer, we need better ways to engage and understand patients. 

***“We need real world evidence” - “How do we build trust with patients” - “How do we better understand our customers”***

*“Patient services will become a competitive driver and are no longer optional for pharmaceutical companies”* – Accenture

*“Developing partnerships with technology companies is another key initiative that pharma has been using to be more patient-centric and digitally enabled across both their commercial and clinical spaces”* - Deloitte

**Key stats:**
- One of the greatest challenges that will face health systems globally in the twenty-first century will be the increasing burden of chronic (chronic) diseases (World Health Organisation)
- Globally, 1 in 3 people have at least one long term condition
- Long-term(chronic) conditions account for 75% of healthcare costs in developed nations
- 50% of prescribed medication is not taken correctly
